# WyzeHub

This is an _unofficial_ Hubitat implementation for Wyze devices. The app offers basic control over supported devices and device groups.

Join the conversation in the [Hubitat Community discussion thread](https://community.hubitat.com/t/79504).
## Supported Devices
Support is currently limiited to devices I have on hand. Devices will be added as I get them or as the community contributes.

### Currently Supported
* Wyze Color Bulb (Meshlight)
* Wyze Lightstrip (Non Pro Model. Single Color.)
* Wyze Plug
* Wyze Outdoor Plug
* Wyze Cam (limited support)

## To be implemented...

* Device Group Update - currenttly after a device group is added, changes to device membership in Wyze are not reflected in Hubitat.

## Troubleshooting

### Auth Issues

  * 2FA *should* work. If you have issue authenticating using 2FA, disable 2FA on your Wyze account and re-enable after connecting WyzeHub.
  * Token refreshing still isn't perfect, and Wyze also seems to randomly flag tokens with a rate limit. 
    * If your devices stop working, it is likely due to a token issue. Check the log for errors.
    * To resolve auth issues, simply re-enter your usename and password in the App settings. This will initiate a new token request.

## Credits and High Fives

The following GitHub repos were of great help in the development of this package:

* üêç [shauntarves/wyze-sdk](https://github.com/shauntarves/wyze-sdk): Unofficial Wyze SDK in Python. Used quite a bit as a reference for this libray.
* üè° [ndejong5/homebridge-wyze-connected-home-op](https://github.com/ndejong5/homebridge-wyze-connected-home-op): Wyze Homebridge driver. I initially started updating this driver to add support for the Color Bulb. Quickly got frustrated with Homebridge and decided to abandon that effort for this one.
* ‚òï [HubitatCommunity/CoCoHue](https://github.com/HubitatCommunity/CoCoHue): Used extensively as a reference for Hubitat app and driver development.
